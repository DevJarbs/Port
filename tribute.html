        <p class="odatrib">Eiichiro Oda is a Japanese manga artist and the creator of the series One Piece (1997-present). </p>
           <p class="odatrib"> With more than 516.6 million tankōbon copies in circulation worldwide, One Piece is both the best-selling manga in history and the best-selling comic series printed in volume, in turn making Oda one of the best-selling fiction authors.</p>
            <p class="odatrib">The series' popularity resulted in Oda being named one of the manga artists that changed the history of manga.</p>
            <p class="odatrib">Eiichiro Oda was born on January 1, 1975, in Kumamoto, Japan. He said that at the age of four he resolved to become a manga artist in order to avoid having to get a "real job".</p>
            <p class="odatrib">His biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball.</p>
            <p class="odatrib">He recalls that his interest in pirates was probably sparked by the popular TV animation series titled Vicky the Viking.</p>
            <p class="odatrib">He submitted a character named Pandaman for Yudetamago's classic wrestling manga Kinnikuman.</p>
            <p class="odatrib"> Pandaman was not only used in a chapter of the manga but would later return as a recurring cameo character in Oda's own works.</p>
