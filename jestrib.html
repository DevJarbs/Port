    <h2>Early Life and Career</h2>
    <p>Harry Styles, in full Harry Edward Styles, (born February 1, 1994, Redditch, Worcestershire, England), British singer, songwriter, and actor, one of the original members of the boy band One Direction and a highly successful solo artist known for his multiple chart-topping singles and albums. Styles became a member of One Direction in 2010, when the group came together to compete on the British music competition television show The X Factor. He later embarked on a career as a solo artist and actor, with forays into fashion.  Styles made his start in music while a student at Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School, where he was the lead singer of the band White Eskimo. In 2010, encouraged by his mother, Styles auditioned for The X Factor. For the show, he performed a rendition of “Isn’t She Lovely,” a song originally written by Stevie Wonder. After failing to advance, Styles was recalled and joined with Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson to compete as a group on the show. The five-member group subsequently became known as One Direction, named at the suggestion of Styles, and ultimately took third place in the final round of the competition. The group released its debut studio album, Up All Night, in 2011. Styles cowrote three songs on the album, which climbed quickly to number two on the U.K. Albums Chart and to number one on the Billboard 200. One Direction’s next four albums—Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013), Four (2014), and Made in the A.M. (2015)—were all hugely successful.</p>

    <h2>Artistry</h2>
    <h4>Musical style and influences</h4>
    <p>Styles's music has been described as soft rock, pop, and rock, with elements of folk and Britpop.[158][159][160][161] The musical style on his debut solo album was called a "mish-mash of Los Angeles' style classic rock and ballads" by NME,[158] invoking an "intimately emotional Seventies soft-rock vibe" by Rolling Stone, and "synthesis[ing] influences from the last half-century of rock" by Time magazine.[162][163] It was influenced by the artists he grew up listening to, such as Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and Fleetwood Mac, as well as the songwriting of Harry Nilsson.[164][165] Styles praised Nilsson's lyrics as being "honest, and so good, and I think it's because he's never trying to sound clever."[165] His second solo album, Fine Line, was seen by NME to have taken, "this nostalgic sound [from his first record] and combined it with soaring pop sensibilities."[166]

        Styles said "I think with music it’s so important to evolve—and that extends to clothes and videos and all that stuff. That’s why you look back at David Bowie with Ziggy Stardust or The Beatles and their different eras—that fearlessness is super inspiring."[167] While making Fine Line he said he kept watching a vintage Bowie clip on his phone, which he used as an inspiring pep talk.[168] He has also cited Freddie Mercury, Elvis Presley, and Paul McCartney (including his side project Wings) as influences, while mentioning Shania Twain as his main inspiration both musically and in fashion.[169][170][171] His favourite album is Astral Weeks by Northern Irish musician Van Morrison, which he called "completely perfect"; he also considers Etta James's album At Last! to be "perfect". Upon listening to Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon as a child, he said he "couldn't really get it, but I just remember being like—this is really fucking cool."[8] Joni Mitchell's 1971 album Blue inspired Styles to contact the album's dulcimer instrumentalist, with whom he worked on Fine Line.[170]</p>
    <h4>Stage performances</h4>
    <p>Styles, as a solo artist, has chosen to tour as a rock artist with a backing band.[172] Styles plays acoustic guitar in addition to providing vocals.[173] Lead guitarist Mitch Rowland and drummer and vocalist Sarah Jones have toured with Styles both during Harry Styles: Live on Tour and Love on Tour.[174] Other members of his band have included the bassist/vocalist Elin Sandberg, pianist Niji Adeleye, percussionist and musical director Pauli Lovejoy, multi-instrumentalist/vocalist Ny Oh, bassist Adam Prendergast, pianist Yaffra, keyboardist/vocalist Claire Uchima, and guitarist/keyboardist/vocalist Charlotte Clark.[175] Jade Yamazaki Stewart from the Seattle Times said of the band, "[Love on Tour] felt more like a 1970s rock festival than a 21st-century arena show from an international pop star."[176]

        Styles has been seen by critics to be an unusually energetic performer since at least 2015.[177] In a 2015 Rolling Stone review of One Direction's concert at MetLife Stadium, Rob Sheffield said, "It's like watching the footage of Secretariat running the Belmont Stakes in 1973 — he's 31 lengths ahead of the other horses, but he speeds up madly for the final stretch because he's so in love with being fast."[177] Styles does not party or ingest substances after his shows because he tries to approach performing like an athlete in order to give fans the best show possible.[178] Craig McLean described his onstage physicality for The Face in 2022 as, "stomping, head-banging exuberance" that is "impossible to resist."[179] His stage presence has been likened to that of Freddie Mercury and Mick Jagger,[179][180] while his charisma and playfulness prompted comparisons to Rod Stewart.[181]</p>

    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>Styles splits his time between two homes in North London, having previously lived above the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles.[249] He sold his Los Angeles residence, having become disillusioned with the city.[250] He also owns a loft apartment in Manhattan.[251] He lived in the attic of producer Ben Winston's home in Hampstead Heath, London, for 20 months at the beginning of his career while he looked for his own house.[8]

        Styles believes in karma, and when Chelsea Handler asked if he believes in God, he stated that he considered himself to be "more spiritual than religious" and that it is "naïve to say nothing exists and there's nothing above us or more powerful than us."[252] In a 2020 interview with Vogue, Styles shared that he practices pilates and meditates daily.[253] He also attends therapy regularly.[45]
        
        He told Vogue in the same interview that he followed a pescatarian diet.[254] In 2022, when fans started throwing chicken nuggets on stage during a concert and chanted that he should eat one, he told them, "I don’t eat chicken, sorry. I don’t eat meat," earning him PETA’s 2022 Best Viral Moment for Animals Award.[255]
        
        Styles confirmed in 2017 that he has polythelia, a condition where a person has more than two nipples.[256]
        
        In May 2019, Styles was named second on the Sunday Times Rich List of musicians in the UK under 30, with an estimated net worth of £58 million, having previously featured third on the previous year's list with an estimated net worth of £50 million.[257][258] He maintained his second-place position on the list in 2020 and 2021, with estimated net worths of £63 million and £75 million, respectively.[259][260] He topped the list in 2022, becoming the richest musician under 30 in the UK, with his net worth being estimated at £100 million.[261]</p>

    <h2>Relationships</h2>
    <p>From November 2011 to January 2012, 17-year-old Styles dated television presenter Caroline Flack; their relationship stirred controversy, as she was 14 years his senior.[262] He briefly dated American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift later in 2012,[263] leading to fan and media speculation about them writing songs about each other after their breakup.[8] From 2017 to 2018, Styles was in a relationship with French-American model Camille Rowe, who inspired his 2019 album Fine Line.[264][265][266] From January 2021 to November 2022, Styles was in a relationship with actress and director Olivia Wilde.[267][268][269] Rolling Stone said in 2022 that "If Styles is already held up to a high standard, his potential partners are held to an unreachable one for some of his fans."[270]</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Sexuality</h2>
    <p>Styles has been repeatedly asked about his sexual orientation in interviews since he was 19 years old.[45][195][271][272][273] When asked in a 2013 interview with British GQ whether he was bisexual, he replied, "Bisexual? Me? I don't think so. I'm pretty sure I'm not."[271] In 2017, when asked if he labeled his sexuality, he said, "No, I've never felt the need to really. I don't feel like it's something I've ever felt like I have to explain about myself."[274] When The Guardian in 2019 questioned the authenticity of his flamboyant dressing style and his perceived sexual ambiguity, he stated:
        Am I sprinkling in nuggets of sexual ambiguity to try and be more interesting? No. ... In terms of how I wanna dress, and what the album sleeve's gonna be, I tend to make decisions in terms of collaborators I want to work with. I want things to look a certain way. Not because it makes me look gay, or it makes me look straight, or it makes me look bisexual, but because I think it looks cool. And more than that, I dunno, I just think sexuality's something that's fun. Honestly? I can't say I've given it any more thought than that.[195]
        
        In a 2022 interview with Better Homes and Gardens, Styles stated that the expectation that he should publicly label his sexual orientation is "outdated". He said, "I've been really open with it with my friends, but that's my personal experience; it's mine," and "the whole point of where we should be heading, which is toward accepting everybody and being more open, is that it doesn't matter, and it's about not having to label everything, not having to clarify what boxes you're checking."[45]</p>
